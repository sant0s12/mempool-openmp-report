\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

This chapter explains your contributions, be it algorithms, architectures, libraries, hardware, or others.
As usual, follow a top-down approach and break the chapter into meaningful sections.
It may even be necessary to split the chapter into multiple chapters (e.g., to separate architecture from implementation in a hardware design).

Derive a structure for this chapter that is meaningful for your report and discuss it with your advisors.
