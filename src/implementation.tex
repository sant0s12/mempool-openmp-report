\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

\begin{itemize}

        were discarded
  \item Minor things like the testing scripts and main function wrapper
\end{itemize}

	This chapter explains your contributions, be it algorithms, architectures, libraries, hardware, or others.
	As usual, follow a top-down approach and break the chapter into meaningful sections.
	It may even be necessary to split the chapter into multiple chapters (e.g., to separate architecture from implementation in a hardware design).

	Derive a structure for this chapter that is meaningful for your report and discuss it with your advisors.
