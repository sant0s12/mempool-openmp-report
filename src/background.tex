\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}

Explain the background and theory underlying your project.
Assume that the average reader has the same knowledge you had \emph{before} undergoing this project.
This chapter should transfer all knowledge necessary to understand the following chapters.

As this and the following chapters are likely longer than a few pages, consider structuring them into sections (but avoid fragmentation by overly fine-grained sectioning).
Use the \verb|\..section{}| command family as illustrated below:

\section{First section}
\label{sec:background_overview}

\subsection{First subsection}

\subsection{Second subsection}

\subsubsection{First subsubsection}

Follow a top-down approach when structuring the chapter, and guide the reader by giving a short overview at the beginning of each section.
Again, you can use labels and references (e.g., referring to \cref{sec:background_overview}).
