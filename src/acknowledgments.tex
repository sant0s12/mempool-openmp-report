\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I'd like to sincerely thank Samuel Riedel and Sergio Mazzola for supervising this project. Their
continuous feedback and encouragement has been very helpful, and it enabled me to stay on track and
make steady progress.

I'd also like to thank Frank GÃ¼rkaynak for getting me in touch with the group, which led to me
learning about this project.
