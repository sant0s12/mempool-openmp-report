\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{ch:conclusion}

Draw your conclusions from the results and summarize your contributions.
Point out aspects that need to be investigated further.

The conclusion can be structured inversely to the introduction:
Summarize how the \emph{evaluation} backs the \emph{solution}, which solves the \emph{problem}.
Describe how your contributions improve the \emph{situation} and what other (potentially newly discovered) problems have to be solved in the future.

Be concise: the conclusion normally fits on a single page and is rarely longer than two pages.
