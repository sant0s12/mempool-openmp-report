\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{ch:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Interesting missing features (like nested parallelism and explicit tasks, as well as more
	      clever ways to create teams) and how performance may be improved further.
    \item This can also be split into two chapters.
\end{itemize}

{\color{red}
Draw your conclusions from the results and summarize your contributions.
Point out aspects that need to be investigated further.

The conclusion can be structured inversely to the introduction:
Summarize how the \emph{evaluation} backs the \emph{solution}, which solves the \emph{problem}.
Describe how your contributions improve the \emph{situation} and what other (potentially newly discovered) problems have to be solved in the future.

Be concise: the conclusion normally fits on a single page and is rarely longer than two pages.
